This paper explores the value co-creation mechanism in cross-border e-commerce, focusing on how online service quality and country of origin (COO) effects influence consumers' cross-border online shopping behavior. We developed a theoretical model of cross-border purchase intention based on co-create theory and two-sided market theory. The model examines how perceived value directly determines customer purchase intention, while three key latent variables - consumer resource, platform service quality (ESQ), and country of origin - indirectly influence purchase decisions. Our empirical analysis reveals that platform service quality has the strongest impact, followed by COO effects, with consumer expertise having a smaller but still significant influence. Statistical results confirm the significance of all antecedent variables, providing important theoretical and practical implications for understanding cross-border e-commerce behavior.

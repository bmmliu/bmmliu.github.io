Masks can help people to reduce inhalation of droplets and the risk of infection. Because of the COVID-19, many governments required people to wear marks to prevent virus spread. In some public places, there are tons of people going back and forth everyday so it’s impossible to settle a human monitor to identify whether everyone wears a mask. This work uses a different training version from YOLOv5 to train the dataset of mask wearing, and we use K-means to find the most appropriate anchors for datasets. Finally, by using data augmentation we get a more accurate model. Compared to human work, this model can be faster and more accurate to find a target and it can save countless money and time.
